## Eminem tribute page

### Made for an FCC project

This is a simple tribute page project created following FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. I go a little beyond following the user stories to practice my **CSS** and **JavaScript** skills.

### Technologies used:

> **HTML**\
> **CSS/SASS**\
> **JavaScript**

---

My aim with this project is to further develop my abilities using **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

- Used **_Flexbox_**, **_Grid_** and **_Media Queries_** to create responsive layout
- Used the **_Fetch API_** to get data locally and from the **_YouTube Data API_**, and display it on the page
- I used a custom domain to host the page on **_000webhost_**. It can be found [here](http://btwonu.com).
